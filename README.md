Rock, paper and scissors in Python for the PYBSTICK26
This is just a little program to train myself in Python. The code is not very simple and heavy but I did the best I could as a beginner.
When you win, lose or if there is a tie the LEDS light up in different colors you can see the colors with "help" in the program. Some variables or functions are in French so I will translate them for you. "Jeu" is for game in english, "Joueur" is for player, "ordi" for the word computer.
disclaimer: the files "main.py" is in english but the "mainfr.py" is in french be careful
Thanks
